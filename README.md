This is a cow-themed version of Connect Four that allows for two-player gameplay. Vanilla JavaScript is utilized
on the frontend to facilitate game logic, respond to user actions, and determine game outcomes. The backend is a RESTful API 
built with Ruby on Rails. The application is styled with custom CSS.

The frontend can be run from the main directory, with the 'open index.html' command in the terminal.
